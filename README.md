Schwimmen Simulation for Practice

This is a simulation of the "Schwimmen" -card game created as part of
the preparation for the MSc SLP by Philippe Möller.

*Running the script:
Run the main.py in your shell to play the game.

*Basic rules:
The goal in a Schwimmen game is to get a score of
31 points. Each player in the game gets 3 cards.
The points are equal to the highest number a player has
in his/her hand. If two or more suits match, add the points up.

At the beginning of a players turn, the player may choose to
exchange 1 or all cards from a pool of 3 different cards.
Additionally, a player may choose to skip the turn.

After every player has played a round, each players`points will
be calculated; the player with the lowest points loses a life.

The game ends when all but 1 player have lost their lives.

*Note:
This simulation does not contain all features of a real Schwimmen game.
For example, in a real game, points are evaluated only after a player
chooses to end a round and not automatically after one round.
